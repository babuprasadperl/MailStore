I located the problem in the getc() of ReadImage using PerlMagick.  I did
not succeed in creating a reduced sized example for my program which
reproduces the problem, so I'm glad I'm not the only one with this problem.
 
Is there are more clarity on the cause of the crash?  Any response from the
developers?
